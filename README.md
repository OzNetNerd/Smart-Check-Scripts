# About

A collection of scripts for use with Trend Micro's Smart Check product. For an automated deployment of Smart Check, see [this repo](https://github.com/OzNetNerd/Smart-Check-Demo).

Each directory in this repo has a README file. It describes what the script does and how to use it.

## API Documentation

The scripts in this repo utilise Smart Check's API. The Swagger docs can be [found here](https://automation.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/article/11_1/smart-check-api-reference?platform=on-premise).
